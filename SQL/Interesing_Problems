My answer:- 

select Doctor,Professor,Singer,Actor
from(
select name,occupation,
row_number() over (partition by occupation order by name) as rn
from occupations)
pivot(
min(name)
for occupation in
('Doctor' as Doctor,'Professor' as Professor, 'Singer' as Singer,'Actor' as Actor)
)
order by rn asc;

Hierarchical Query a sample:-

select ename,job, prior ename, level
from emp
start with mgr is null
connect by  prior empno = mgr
order by level;


SELECT last_name, employee_id, manager_id, LEVEL
      FROM employees
      START WITH employee_id = 100
      CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id
      ORDER SIBLINGS BY last_name;
